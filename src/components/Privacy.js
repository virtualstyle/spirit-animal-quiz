          <p className="content">
            Like most website operators, Spirit Animal Quiz collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. Spirit Animal Quiz&#39;s purpose in collecting
            non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
            Spirit Animal Quiz&#39;s visitors use its website. From time to
            time, Spirit Animal Quiz may release non-personally-identifying
            information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends
            in the usage of its website.
          </p>
          <p className="content">
            Spirit Animal Quiz also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
            users and for users leaving comments on
            https://github.com/virtualstyle/spirit-animal-quiz blog posts.
            Spirit Animal Quiz only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
            addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information as described below.

          <h2 className="subtitle">Security</h2>

          <p className="content">
            The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
            remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
            commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information,
            we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
